# TicTacToeV2

An innovative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where only the most recent 8 moves are displayed on the board. As new moves are made, the oldest moves are automatically removed, adding a dynamic and strategic element to the gameplay.

## Overview

Inspired by a captivating TikTok video, I decided to recreate this unique version of Tic Tac Toe to explore complex JavaScript logic and enhance traditional gameplay. The result is a fast-paced, engaging experience that challenges players to think strategically about their moves and the limited board space.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Only the last 8 moves are visible, keeping the game fresh and challenging.
- **Real-Time Move Management**: Automatically deletes older moves as new ones are made, ensuring a constantly evolving game state.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI, allowing players to jump right in without a steep learning curve.
